# Food-Price-Prediction-using-SPSS-Multiple-Regression

This project aimed to uncover the key drivers influencing the base_price of food items in a distribution network by applying Multiple Linear Regression in IBM SPSS. Through rigorous statistical modeling and analysis, we arrived at several significant insights:

# Strong Predictive Power:
The model achieved an RÂ² of 0.910, meaning it explained 91% of the variance in base price. This indicates that the selected independent variables are highly effective in predicting price behavior.

# Significant Predictors Identified:
Among all the predictors analyzed, checkout_price and num_orders were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05), with checkout_price having the most substantial positive impact on base price. In contrast, variables like meal_id, center_id, and week did not significantly influence the price.

# Model Validated by ANOVA:
The F-statistic was high (4054.172) and statistically significant (p < 0.0005), confirming that the overall regression model was a good fit for the data.

# Reliable Coefficients for Forecasting:
The regression equation derived from the model provides a useful tool for predicting base prices based on future values of checkout_price and num_orders. This equation can be integrated into pricing strategies or automated decision-support systems.

# Business Impact:
The analysis equips stakeholders with data-backed insights to optimize pricing, reduce arbitrary cost decisions, and better align pricing strategies with demand behavior.

# Final Takeaway:
This project demonstrates how statistical modeling, when combined with domain knowledge and clean data, can convert raw transactional records into actionable business intelligence. The regression approach not only quantified key relationships but also highlighted where pricing efforts should be focused to maximize revenue efficiency.
